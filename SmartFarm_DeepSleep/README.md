# SmartFarm_DeepSleep Project for ESP8266, ESP32

## SmartFarm_DeepSleep demonstrates how to use DeepSleep in ESP32 and ESP8266

In the sample project, you can use these features:

1. Deep Sleep in ESP8266 and ESP32, with configurables DeepSleep time. 
2. Configurable sensor type, without having to rewrite code such as DHT type (DHT11,DHT22, AM2302, MW33, etc.), Soil Moist Sensor type (Capacitive, Resistive). 
3. Many configurable parameters, such as alarm setpoint, pump running setpoint, etc... 

## To improve

Use ISR-based hardware timers instead of software timers so that the pump functions is ISR-based.
