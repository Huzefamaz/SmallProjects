## Master Controller Project for ESP32 and ESP8266

### MasterController for ESP32/ESP8266, using Blynk Bridge to control slave controllers

In the sample project, you can use these features:

1. This example demontrates the use of a Master Controller (ESP32/ESP8266) to control 8 different Slave Controllers running Blynk/Alexa
   - Each Slave Controller is doing diferent tasks inside an imaginary house.
   - One of the Slave Controller is ESP8266-based RC-433MHz controller. 
   - Another one is SONOFF WiFi Smart SW.
   
2. This example uses 2-dimensional array of struct(ure)s to enable timers to control objects in Slave Controllers via Blynk Bridge.
