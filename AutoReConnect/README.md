## AutoReconnect to demonstrate the usage of WiFi and Blynk AutoReConnect feature for ESP8266, ESP32

### Why do we need this `AutoReconnect`?

Imagine you have a system with `mission-semi-critical` functions, measuring water level and control the sump pump or doing something much more important using extensive GUI, such as medical equipments, security and/or fire-smoke alarm, etc. You normally use a `software timer to poll`, or even place the function in loop(). But what if another function is blocking the `loop()` or `setup()`.

So your function might not be executed, and the result would be disastrous.

You'd prefer to have your function called, no matter what happening with other functions (busy loop, bug, etc.).

The best choice is to use a `Hardware Timer with Interrupt` in cooperation with an `Input Pin Interrupt` to call your function.

The catch is your function is now part of an `ISR (Interrupt Service Routine)`, and must be `lean / mean`, and follow certain rules. More to read on:

https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/external-interrupts/attachinterrupt/

***What if your to-be-called function is a little bit `fat and lazy`, with some delay(), waiting loops, etc. making it's incompatible with `hardware interrupt` ?***

The second best choice is solutions which :

1. Use non-blocking functions in `loop()`
2. Permit `non-blocking AutoReConnect` feature to
  - connect to the `best WiFi AP available` in the AP list (according to quality: highest RSSI/reliability APs first)
  - connect to the `best Blynk server available` in the Blynk-Server list (according to priority: local Blynk servers first, then Cloud-based servers next)

## Design principles of AutoReConnect

The design principles are as follows:

1. Normal functions in the `loop()`, as well as those called by `timers` which are considered `mission-semi-critical`, and must not be interfered or blocked by any other bad tasks, `intentionally or unintentionally`. This principle can be applied to any of your projects.
2. WiFi is considered just a communications function. Being connected or not must not interfere with the `mission-semi-critical` tasks.
3. Enable multiple WiFi APs in a list, so that the program can search and use the best and still available AP in case the currently used AP is out-of-service.
4. Blynk is considered just a `Graphical-User-Interface (GUI)`. Being connected or not must not interfere with the `mission-semi-critical` tasks.
5. Enable multiple Blynk Servers (local and cloud-based servers unlimited) in a list, so that the program can search and use the best and still available Blynk Server in case the currently used server is out-of-service.

Certainly, with Blynk GUI, we can achieve many more great features, such as `remote check and control, configurable test case and value` , etc. when possible and available.

This can be applied in many projects requiring reliable system control, where `good, bad, or no connection has no effect on the operation of the system`.
